\subsection{State}
%Suppose that we want to generate a state machine $sm$ whose states are listed by $lstates$. 
%A common state interface $IState$ is created. The interface contains three methods, namely, \ti{entry}, \ti{exit}, and \ti{doActivity} respectively corresponding to three state actions. The benefice of using these methods is to increase performance in invoking state actions. To preserve the hierarchy of composite states, the interface also has two attributes called \ti{actives} and \ti{pres} referring to current and previous active sub-states in case of the presence of history states.

%three methods, namely, \ti{entry}, \ti{exit}, and \ti{doActivity} respectively corresponding to three state actions. The benefice of using these methods is to increase performance in invoking state actions. To preserve the hierarchy of composite states, the interface also 
has two attributes called \ti{actives}, to preserve the hierarchy of composite states, and \ti{previousActives} referring to current and previous active sub-states in case of the presence of history states.
Each UML state is transformed into an instance of \tb{IState} and a state ID is assigned (which is a child element of an enumeration). 
During initialization, each instance initializes its attributes to a default value meaning inactive state. 

In the following sections, 
we only consider C++ as a specific generated language. 
The discussion of other object-oriented languages is much similar since these share the same concepts.

Listing \ref{lst:IStateCpp} shows the state type and its instances. 
\ti{STATE\_MAX} is the number of states. 
The state actions such as entry/exit/doActivity are generated to corresponding common methods containing action codes.
For example, \ttt{entry} in the listing implements all of the state action codes.
%The actions are named depending on the name of the corresponding. 

%//discuss the limitation of doActivity implementation vs specification.

The procedure to generate the code for states is shown in Listing \ref{lst:procedure1}. It first creates the state interface $IState$ (in C++, it is either a class or a struct). The array attribute is then created with the number of states as its size. Each state is also associated with a state ID which is a child of an enumeration. Finally, the constructor of $C$ is created to initialize and make methods of the attribute instances refer to \ti{entry/exit/doActivity} action methods of $C$. The implementation of action methods in the context class $C$ is similar to the delegation pattern proposed by the authors in \cite{Niaz2004} but dramatically decreases the memory consumption since only one common interface for all states is created instead of a class for each state in \cite{Niaz2004}.

\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape=true, caption=Procedure to create code for states, label=lst:procedure1, frame=single]
IState = genClass('IState', $\emptyset$, $\emptyset$);
stateIdEnum = genEnum('StateIdEnum');
foreach s in lstates
  genEnumLit(stateIdEnum, s.name + '_ID');
  mtd = genMtd(s.name + '_entry', C, 
			null, null);
  genBody(mtd, toString(entry(s)));
  ...
genEnumLit(stateIdEnum, 'NUM_STATES');  
genAttr('states', C, IState, NUM_STATES); 
genMtd(C.name, C, null, null);
\end{lstlisting}
\end{comment}


State \ttt{doActivity}s, as specified by UML, are run concurrently. 
Each \ti{doActivity} is then run within a permanent thread and a mutex is created for controlling it. 
%The \ti{doActivity} thread is initialized, waits for a start signal, executes the \ti{doActivity} code, generates a completion if the state is atomic and still active, and goes back to the waiting point as the paradigm above. 
Listing \ref{lst:doActivity} shows a code segment for \ti{doActivity} threads. The method \ttt{doActivityThread} takes as input a state id to use and call the appropriate mutex and \ti{doActivity}, respectively. 
The method does nothing and stays in a waiting point if the state corresponding to the input parameter state identifier is inactive (line 5).
If the state is active, a start signal is sent to this thread method to start the execution of \ti{doActivity}.
The generated code typically follows the common paradigm in POSIX threads \cite{Posix}.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Example code generated for doActivity, label=lst:doActivity, language=C++,float][H]
while(true) {
	pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex[stateId]);
	while(!isStarts[stateId]) { 
		//await start signal     
		pthread_cond_wait(&cond, &mutex[stateId];}	
	doActivity(stateId);
	isStarts[stateId] = false;//reset wait flag
	pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex[stateId]);
	if (!isStops[stateId]) {
		if(stateId==S0_ID||...){//atomic states
			pushCompletionEvent(stateId);
		}
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{Region}
\label{subsubsec:region-trans}
Our approach considers regions as elements to be transformed. 
Specifically, each region has two methods: entering and exiting. 
The entering method controls how a region $r$ is entered from an outside transition and the exiting method exits completely a region by executing exit actions of sub-states from innermost to outermost.

\begin{figure}
	\hspace*{-1.2cm}  
	\centering
	\includegraphics[clip, trim=0.2cm 0.2cm 0.2cm 0.2cm, width=1.0\columnwidth + 1.2cm]{figures/EnteringStateExample.pdf}
	\caption{Example illustrating different ways entering a composite state} 
	\label{fig:entering}
\end{figure}

A region can be entered two different ways: (1) \tb{entering by default}: the transition ends at the border of composite states; and (2) \tb{cross transition}: entering at a direct or an indirect sub-vertex of composite states.
The two entering ways execute the entry action of the containing composite state after the transition effect. 
%\ti{doActivity(ctner(r))} is then signaled to be run in its associated thread. 
The executions afterwards are different for each way. 
To illustrate, we use an example as in Fig. \ref{fig:entering} with \ti{S1} as a target composite state. 
\ti{t1} is in the way (1) while \ti{t2, t5, t6} in the way 2. 

The entering method associated with the region of \ti{S1} has a parameter $enter\_mode$ telling how the entering should be executed. 
$enter\_mode$ takes values depending the number of transitions coming to the composite state. %$S1$: $\#values(s) = \\ \#\{v \in vertices(s)| v.kind=initial\} + \\ \#\{v \in vertices(s)| \exists t \in T_{ins}(v), src(t) \notin vertices(s)\} + \\ 
%\#\{v \in vertices^+(s)\setminus vertices(s)|\exists t \in T_{ins}(v), src(t) \notin vertices^+(s)\}$. 
%In this case these values are $\{DEFAULT = 0, SH\_MODE = 1, S2\_MODE = 2, S4\_MODE=3, ENP_MODE=4\}$. 
The detail of how these modes are implemented in specific languages are not discussed here.
Listing \ref{lst:region} shows the generated C++.

  
\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Example code generated for the region of S1, label=lst:region,float]
void S1Region1Enter(int enter_mode){
if (enter_mode == DEFAULT) {
  states[S1_ID].actives[0] = S3_ID;
  entry(S3_ID);  sendStartSignal(S3_ID);
  S3Region1Enter(DEFAULT);
} else if (enter_mode == S2_MODE) { 
  //..
} if (enter_mode == SH_MODE) {
  StateIDEnum his;
  if (states[S1_ID].previousActives[0]!=STATE_MAX){
    his=states[S1_ID].previousActives[0];
  } else {
    his = S2_ID;
  }
  states[S1_ID].actives[0] = his;
  entry(his);  sendStartSignal(his);
  if (S3_ID == his) {
    S3Region1Enter(S3_REGION1_DEFAULT);
  } 
} else if (enter_mode == S4_MODE) {
  states[S1_ID].actives[0] = S3_ID;
  entry(S3_ID);  sendStartSignal(S3_ID);
  S3Region1Enter(S4_MODE);
} else if (enter_mode == ENP_MODE) {...}
\end{lstlisting}




%For each value in $values(s)$, the region of $S1$ is entered and executes different actions. 
By default, the region's active sub-state is set after the execution of any effect associated with the initial transition. 
Therefore, $S3$ is set as active sub-state of $S1$. 
Entering at (\ti{S2}) sets the active sub-state of \ti{S1} directly to \ti{S2}. 
In case of an indirect sub-state ($S4$), the entry action of $S3$ is executed before $S4$ is set as the active-sub state of $S3$ and the entry execution of $S4$. 
It is worth noting that after the execution of each entry action, a start signal is sent to activate the waiting thread associated with \ti{doActivity} of the corresponding state.

Transitioning from a vertex to a sub-vertex of the composite state (transition from $S0$ to $SH$ is a particular case) is not as simple as that of two states. This is detailed in the next section.


The method generated for exiting a region is simpler than that of entering.
It basically executes the exit actions of all the active sub-states from innermost to outermost.
\subsection{Event}
\label{subsec:event}
Similar to the approach in \cite{niaz_mapping_2004}, one method is generated for each event. 
An event enumeration \ti{EventId} is created whose children are event identifiers associated with events. 
%Suppose $levents$ is the list of events which can be processed by the state machine $sm$. 
The event list of a state machine contains explicitly defined events and a special event called completion event, which is implicitly implemented. 
A completion event is fired when either the execution of the \ti{doActivity} of simple/atomic state completes or all regions of a composite state have reached final states. 
For each event type, the pattern is realized as followings:

\vskip 0.1cm	
\noindent
\tb{CallEvent}:                                            When its associated operation is called, the event processing waits and locks the main mutex protecting the run-to-completion semantics as previously mentioned, and executes the event processing (see \ref{subsec:deadlock}). 

\vskip 0.1cm	
\noindent		
\tb{SignalEvent}:                                          An API \ti{sendSignal} is created for environment code to interact and send an instance of the signal associated with the event by calling it. 
When the API is called, an event is emitted and written into the event queue.                                             
		
		
\vskip 0.1cm	
\noindent		
\tb{TimeEvent}:                                            A thread associated with the event is created and initialized at the initialization.
Within the thread execution, its associated method waits for a signal, which is sent after the execution of the entry of an accepting state, to start sleeping for a duration specified by the event. 
%The state must have at least one outgoing transitions triggered by the event. 
When the relative time expires, the event is emitted and written to the event queue if the state is still active.                                         

\vskip 0.1cm
\noindent		
\tb{ChangeEvent}:                                          Similarly to time events, a thread is initialized and its method waits for a starting signal. 
The method checks whether the value of the boolean expression of the event is updated from false to true. 
If so, the event is committed to the event queue.   
The expression is expressed by attributes of the class owning the state machine.
The starting signal is sent if one of the expression's constituents (attributes of the class) changes.
We track the changes of the attributes' values by using setters of the attributes.
For example, for an expression $x + y > 10$, \ti{x} and \ti{y} are extracted as constituents.
The setters (\ti{setX} and \ti{setY}) are automatically generated.
They do not only affect the value of \ti{x} and \ti{y} but also send the starting signal to the thread.                         


\begin{comment}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \ti{CallEvent} $ce$: The associated operation $op(ce)$ can be either synchronous or asynchronous. When $op(ce)$ is called, it waits and locks the main mutex protecting the run-to-completion semantics, and executes $mtd_{ce}$. Contrarily, the parameters of the asynchronous operation are used to create a signal which is transformed similarly to the case of $SignalEvent$.
	
	\item \ti{SignalEvent} $se$: $SignalEvent$ is asynchronous. 
	The signal associated with $se$ is written into the event queue of the active class $C$ by an operation which takes as input the signal. 
	
	\item \ti{TimeEvent} $te$: A thread $teThread$ associated with $te$ is created and initialized at the initialization of the state machine. 
	Within the execution of $teThread$, the method associated $te$ waits for a signal, which is sent after the execution of the entry of a state $s \in \{v \in V|\exists t \in T_{outs}(v), te \in events(t)\}$, to start sleeping for a duration $d$ of $te$. 
	When the duration expires, $te$ is emitted and written to the event queue if $s$ is still active.
	
	\item \ti{ChangeEvent} $che$: Similar to $TimeEvent$, a thread $cheThread$ is initialized at initialization but the associated method $mtd$ does not wait for a signal to start. $mtd$ periodically checks whether the value of the associated boolean expression $ex(che)$ changes by comparing the current value with the previous value. 
	If a change happen, $che$ is committed to the event queue.
	
	\item \ti{Any}: any of the above events can trigger the associated transitions.
\end{itemize}
\end{comment}

As above presented, all asynchronous incoming events are stored in a runtime priority queue, in which each event type has a priority. Completion event always has the highest priority. 
Others are equal by default. 
%Fig. \ref{fig:eventqueue} shows the generic structure of events stored in the queue.  
Event type, priority, identifier, associated state \ti{stateId} of completion events, and signal data are specified in an internal structure. 
The associated state is responsible to specify which atomic/simple state completes its \ti{doActivity} execution or the composite state whose sub-states have reached final states. 
%The event method associated with \ti{Completion Event} executes a check on \ti{stateId} (see Listing \ref{lst:event}, line 1).
%The event data contain marshaled%\footnote{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshalling$\_$(computer$\_$science)} 
%parameters of \ti{SignalEvent}'s signal or \ti{CallEvent}'s parameters.

\subsection{Transitions}

%To process events, for each event, a method is implemented in $C$. 
Each event triggers a list of transitions. 
%We define $dp(v)$ as a function returning the depth of a vertex $v$, in which $dp(v) = 1$ if $v$ is a top vertex.
We suppose $T_{trig}(e)$ is the transition list triggered by the event $e$, and $S_{trig}(e)$ is a depth-ordered (from innermost to outermost) set of the source states of the transitions in $T_{trig}(e)$. 
%To present how the body of event methods is generated, we define functions as followings:

\begin{comment}
{\small
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{0em}
	\item Vertex depth $dp(v)$ returns the depth of a vertex.
	If $v$ is a top vertex, $dp(v) = 1$.
			%\begin{equation}
			%dp(v) =    \left\{
			%\begin{array}{ll}
			%1 & \ti{v is a root vertex}  \\
			%dp(ctner(v)) + 1& otherwise \\
			%\end{array} 
			%\right.
			%\end{equation}
			
	\item $Map_{e}(s) \subset S_{trig(e)} | \forall sub \in Map_e(s): ctner(sub) = s$.
	%, $Prt(e) = \{s \in V| Map_{e}(v) \neq \emptyset\}$. 
	$Prt(e)$ is an ordered list whose length is $len(Prt\{e\})$ and elements are accessed by indexes. 
	The order of $Prt(e)$ is defined as: $\forall i, j \leq len(Prt\{e\})$, 
	\\ if $i < j, dp(Prt(e).get(i)) \geq dp(Prt(e).get(j))$. 	
\end{itemize}
}
\end{comment}

Algorithm \ref{alg:eventproc} describes how to generate the body of an event method. 
It first finds the innermost active states which are able to react $e$ by orderly looping over $S_{trig}(e)$.
This is to ensure that, in case of multiple transitions triggered by the event, the generated code for the transitions outgoing from innermost states will be executed.    
For each transition from an innermost state, code for active states and deferred events, guard checking, and transition code segments are generated by $GEN\_CHECK$, $GEN\_GUARD(t)$ and \ti{GEN\_TRANS}, respectively. 
If the identifier of $e$ is equal to one of the deferred event list of the corresponding state (not shown in this paper), $GEN\_CHECK$ generates code, which checks whether the event to be deferred and pushes the event to a deferred event queue managed by the runtime main thread.
The latter also pushes the deferred events back to the main queue once one of the pending events is processed and the active state is changed.

For a transition $t$, $GEN\_CHECK$ can generate single or multiple active state checking code. 
The latter occurs if the target of the transition is a pseudo state join because the transitions incoming to a $join$ are fired if and only if all of their source states are active. 
The detailed discussion on these is not presented due to space limitation. Listing \ref{lst:event}, lines 2-3 show a portion of the code with multiple checking generated for the completion event processing method.
The transitions \ti{t14} and \ti{t15} incoming to $Join1$ are executed if \ti{S6} and \ti{S7} are active. 
In addition, the code portion checks the state associated with the current completion event emitted upon the completion of either \ti{S6}'s or \ti{S7}'s \ti{doActivity}.  
In lines 4-6, the code concurrently exits the sub-states of \ti{S6} by using \ti{FORK} and \ti{JOIN}, which are respectively used to spawn and wait for a thread, for the region methods associated with \ti{S6}'s orthogonal regions, which actually exit \ti{S7} and \ti{S8}. 
Then, \ti{exit(S6)} is executed before the concurrency of transition effects \ti{t14} and \ti{t15} is taken into account.

%It generates the code checking for active states respecting the UML semantics in which the innermost states process the incoming event first. To do this, it first looks in the source state list $S_{trig(e)}$ for the innermost states that accept the event triggering its outgoing transitions. If these found states are children of a concurrent state, $genStateCheck$ generates the checking codes run in parallel, which will be described later in \ref{subsubsec:thread}. Otherwise said, sequential code is generated.

\ti{GEN\_TRANS} is able to generate code for transitions between two vertexes. 
Algorithm \ref{alg:transitiongeneration} shows how it works. 
The generated code is contained by the deferral events, active states, and guard checking.

Firstly, Algorithm \ref{alg:transitiongeneration} looks for the $s_{ex}$ and $s_{en}$ vertexes contained in the same region and respectively containing the source and target vertexes of the transition $t$.
For example, $s_{ex}$ and $s_{en}$ in case of the $t3$ transition are $S0$ and $S1$ contained by the top region.
If the transition $t$ is part of a compound transition (we use the algorithm presented in \cite{balser2004interactive,Knapp2004} to compute compound transitions), which involves some $junction$s, IF-ELSE statements for junctions are generated first (as PSSM says $junction$ is evaluated before any action). 
The composite state is exited by calling the associated exiting region methods (FORK and JOIN for orthogonal regions) in lines 4-9 and followed by the generated code of transition effects (lines 10-15). 
If the parent state $s_{en}$ of the target vertex $v_t$ is a state (composite state), the associated entry is executed (lines 16-18).
Entering region methods are then called once the above code completes its execution (lines 19-24). 
If the target $v_t$ of the transition $t$ is a pseudo state, the generation pattern corresponding to the pseudo-state types is called. These patterns are shown in Table \ref{table:pseudo-patterm}.

Note that, the procedure in \ref{alg:transitiongeneration} only applies for external transitions. Due to space limitation, the detail of generating local and internal transitions is not discussed here but the only difference is that the composite state containing the transitions is not exited.

\begin{comment}
\subsubsection{Example Code} Listing \ref{lst:event} shows a code segment generated for the processing of $verifyingPIN$. Single checking (line 1) checks whether $Idle$ is the current active state, in which $activeStateID$ is the identifier of the current root active state. The $doActivity$ behavior of $Idle$ is then stopped upon receiving a stop signal. The effect of $t2$, $effect(t3)$ and $effect(t4)$ are then executed after $exit(Idle)$. The execution of $emtry(Verifying)$ then follows the changing of root active state to $Verifying$. $doActivity(Verifying)$ is triggered and followed by concurrently entering the two orthogonal regions of $Verifying$ with appropriate modes.

The discussion of Listing \ref{lst:event1} is similar to Listing \ref{lst:event} except that a multiple checking is executed (line 1-2) instead of a single one. The evaluation for $Junction1$ is executed (line 4) before any other actions (semantic conformance) to decide the decision should be taken (line 10-17).
